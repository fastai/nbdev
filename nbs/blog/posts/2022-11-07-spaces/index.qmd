[Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/launch) provides an easy ways to deploy a web app with python.  [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) is one of my favorite tools for building these web apps.  For example, the cover-image for this blog post was generated with a [Gradio App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion)![^1]  Gradio also allows you to prototype your web apps in notebooks, which allow you to iterate fast.  Unfortunately, Hugging Face Spaces requires you to package your web application code as a python script named `app.py`.

However, **thanks to [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai), you can deploy a Gradio app to Spaces from a notebook without having to refactor your code into a script!**   When you finish this tutorial, you will have an app that looks like this:

[![<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/hamel/hfspace_demo">A Gradio app</a> that shows the size of a HF Dataset.](final_app.png)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hamel/hfspace_demo)

_The above app allows you to lookup the size of any [Hugging Face Dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index), using the [Hugging Face Datasets Server API](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets-server/index)._


Authoring your spaces in notebooks offers a number of benefits such as the ability to:

- Document your code (with `quarto` or `nbdev`)
- Prototype and author your code (with `nbdev.export.export_nb`)
- Test your code (with `nbdev_test`)

... All from the same environment!


## 1. Create a Gradio-enabled Space on Hugging Face

The first step is to create a space and select the appropriate sdk (which is Gradio in this example), according to [these instructions](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview#creating-a-new-space):

![create a Hugging Face Space](create_space.png)

After you are done creating the space, clone the repo locally.  In this example, I ran the command `git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/hamel/hfspace_demo`.


## 2. Create A Notebook

To follow along, create a notebook called `app.ipynb` in the root of your newly cloned repo. Alternatively, a minimal version of this notebook can also be [found here](https://gist.github.com/hamelsmu/35be07d242f3f19063c3a3839127dc67).

## 3. Make an app with Gradio

Below, I will create a [gradio](https://gradio.app/) app in a notebook and show you how to deploy it to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces). 

First, lets import the libraries we need, which in this case are `gradio` and `fastcore`:


```python
#|export
import gradio as gr
from fastcore.net import urljson, HTTPError
```

Next, write the functions your gradio app will use.  Because of [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/blog/posts/2022-07-28-nbdev2/), you can prototype and package your code all in one place.  **The special comment `#|export` marks which cells will be sent to a python script** (more on this later). Note that there are only three cells in this notebook with the `#|export` directive.


```python
#|export
def size(repo:str):
    "Returns the size in GB of a HuggingFace Dataset."
    url = f'https://huggingface.co/api/datasets/{repo}'
    try: resp = urljson(f'{url}/treesize/main')
    except HTTPError: return f'Did not find repo: {url}'
    gb = resp['size'] / 1e9
    return f'{gb:.2f} GB'
```

`size` takes as an input a [Hugging Face Dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) repo and returns the total size in GB of the data.

For example, I can check the size of [tglcourse/CelebA-faces-cropped-128](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tglcourse/CelebA-faces-cropped-128) like so:


```python
size("tglcourse/CelebA-faces-cropped-128")
```




    '5.49 GB'



You can construct a simple UI with the `gradio.interface` and then call the `launch` method of that interface to display a preview in a notebook.  This is a great way to test your app to see if it works:


```python
#|export
iface = gr.Interface(fn=size, inputs=gr.Text(value="tglcourse/CelebA-faces-cropped-128"), outputs="text")
iface.launch(height=450, width=500)
```
    
    
    Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7861
    
    To create a public link, set `share=True` in `launch()`.

```{python}
#| echo: false
# this cell is required in order to spoof quarto to allow me to put an image directly after a cell output.
```

![](gradio_local.png)
   

Note how running the `launch()` method in a notebook runs a webserver in the background.  Below, I call the `close()` method to close the webserver.


```python
# this is only necessary in a notebook
iface.close()
```

    Closing server running on port: 7861


## 4. Convert This Notebook Into A Gradio App

In order to host this code on Hugging Face Spaces, you will export parts of this notebook to a script named `app.py`.  As a reminder, this is what the special `#|export` comment that you have seen in cells above do!  You can export code from this notebook like so:


```python
from nbdev.export import nb_export
nb_export('app.ipynb', lib_path='.', name='app')
```

### Understanding what is generated

Notice how the contents of app.py only contain the exported cells from this notebook:



```python
!cat app.py
```

:::{.cell-output}

```python
# AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! File to edit: app.ipynb.

# %% auto 0
__all__ = ['iface', 'size']

# %% app.ipynb 6
import gradio as gr
from fastcore.net import urljson, HTTPError

# %% app.ipynb 8
def size(repo:str):
    "Returns the size in GB of a HuggingFace Dataset."
    url = f'https://huggingface.co/api/datasets/{repo}'
    try: resp = urljson(f'{url}/treesize/main')
    except HTTPError: return f'Did not find repo: {url}'
    gb = resp['size'] / 1e9
    return f'{gb:.2f} GB'

# %% app.ipynb 12
iface = gr.Interface(fn=size, inputs=gr.Text(value="tglcourse/CelebA-faces-cropped-128"), outputs="text")
iface.launch(height=450, width=500)

```

### Fill out `requirements.txt`

You must supply a `requirements.txt` file so the Gradio app knows how to build your dependencies.  In this example, the only dependency other than Gradio is `fastcore`.  You don't need to specify Gradio itself as a dependency in `requirements.txt`, so our `requirements.txt` file has only one dependency:


```python
%%writefile requirements.txt
fastcore
```

    Writing requirements.txt


_Note: you may want to add operating system dependencies in addition to python dependencies.  You can do this via a `packages.txt` file as [documented here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-dependencies#adding-your-own-dependencies)._

## 5. Launch Your Gradio App

To launch your gradio app, you need to commit the changes to the Hugging Face repo:

```
git add -A; git commit -m "Add application files"; git push
```

# Voilà!  Enjoy your Gradio App

After a couple of minutes, you will see your app published!  This app is published [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hamel/hfspace_demo).


# Shameless Plug: [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/blog/posts/2022-07-28-nbdev2/)

Hopefully you felt something magical while doing this example.  Even though the target application required you to write a python script (`app.py`), you didn't have to refactor your script from a notebook!  I believe that you shouldn't have to refactor your code and switch contexts even when creating python packages!
