    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source Files\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two mediums in which you can author documentation in nbdev:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "2. Quarto Markdown (.qmd)\n",
    "\n",
    "For most cases, you will use Jupyter Notebooks.  However, you may choose to author a document in Quarto Markdown if there is no code on that particular page.  When in doubt, we recommend using notebooks as they are more versatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of notebooks, nbdev pre-processes them to add, remove or change the content before passing it to Quarto.  In some cases, nbdev even executes certain cells in order to render the documentation properly.  The mechanics of this are discussed in the [Notebook Processor](#notebook-processor) section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For markdown files, [Quarto](https://quarto.org) renders these directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Processor\n",
    "\n",
    "Nbdev does special pre-processing on notebooks based on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Directives**: Directives are special comments that allow you to perform operations on cells.  For example, the comment `#|hide` allows you to hide cell inputs and outputs.  You can read more about directives [on this page](./directives.ipynb). Directives that are unique to nbdev and not supported by Quarto are removed from the notebook before being passed to Quarto.\n",
    "2. **Front Matter**: Front matter allows you to specify document-level options so you don't have to repeat them on each cell.  (Similarly, `_quarto.yml` allows you to specify project-level options.)  You can read more about Quarto front-matter [here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The directives and front-matter are used by a **Processing Pipeline** to transform notebooks.  Many of these pre-processing steps are defined in [`nbdev.processors`](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/blob/master/nbdev/processors.py), which are then run by `nbdev.process.NBProcessor`. Some of these pre-processing steps involve running code (with [execnb](https://github.com/fastai/execnb)) in order to dynamically render API documentation. This process is explained in the [How show_doc works](#how-show_doc-works) section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quarto\n",
    "\n",
    "[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is the mechanism nbdev uses to generate webpages from notebooks. It is useful to visit the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) and understand how it works.  nbdev automatically generates the Quarto configuration files `_quarto.yml` and `sidebar.yml` for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can override any settings in `_quarto.yml` by defining a `custom.yml` file.  This is explained further in the [Customizing Quarto](#customizing-quarto) section.  We explain how to customize your sidebar in the [Customizing The Sidebar](#customizing-the-sidebar) section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Site\n",
    "\n",
    "Quarto has a built-in [static site generator](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/) that will generate HTML, Javascript and CSS files.  These files will be placed in the `doc_path` directory as specified in your project's `settings.ini` file, which is `_docs/` by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a diagram on how these concepts fit together."

You can see an example of this by inspecting the folder structure of [the notebooks directory in nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/tree/master/nbs) and the corresponding left-hand sidebar on this website.  Leading numbers in filenames and directories are ignored when naming elements of the sidebar (which you can see examples of in this project's notebooks directory).\n",

After running this command, all of the files for your documentation site will be located in the `_docs/` directory (the location is configurable by `doc_path` in `settings.ini`) at the root of your repository. This directory is not checked into git and is ignored by `.gitignore`, but you can use these files to deploy to any hosting platform you want.\n",
