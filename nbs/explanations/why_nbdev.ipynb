    "Popular Python documentation standards such as [numpy docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) and [sphinx](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html) facilitate documentation of source code with docstrings, which are limited in their expressiveness and functionality. Notebooks, on the other hand, offer a richer medium for authoring documentation (with markdown and code cells) compared to docstrings, and unlock new ways of documenting your code that are otherwhise infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, traditional testing frameworks such as [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) and [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) encourage writing tests in a separate context that is disjointed from the associated source code and documentation. With nbdev, you write tests in the same context as your source code and documentation, such that tests can optionally become part of the narrative within your documentation.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Since nbdev allows your colleagues and users to view the tests, code and documentation in a single context with a REPL that invites experimentation, the way you author code, documentation and tests in nbdev are very different than traditional software development workflows."
