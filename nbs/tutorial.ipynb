In practice, programming in this way can feel very different to the kind of programming many of you will be familiar with, since we've mainly be taught coding techniques that are (at least implicitly) tied to the underlying tools we have access to. I've found that programming in a \"notebook first\" way can make me 2-3x more productive than I was before (when we used vscode, Visual Studio, vim, PyCharm, and similar tools).\n",
