### FrontmatterProc

>  FrontmatterProc (nb)

*A YAML and formatted-markdown frontmatter processor*

YAML frontmatter can be added to notebooks in one of two ways:

1.  By adding a raw notebook cell with `---` as the first and last
    lines, and YAML between them, or
2.  A specially formatted markdown cell. The first line should be start
    with a single `#` (creating an H1 heading), and becomes the title.
    Then, optionally, a line beginning with `>` (creating a quote
    block), which becomes the description. Finally, zero or more lines
    beginning with `-` (creating a list), each of which contains YAML.
    (If you already have “title” defined in frontmatter in a raw cell,
    then markdown cells will be ignored.)

For instance, our test notebook contains the following markdown cell:

    # a title
    > A description
    - key1: value1
    - key2: value2
    - categories: [c1, c2]

It also contains the following raw cell:

    ---
    execute:
      echo: false
    ---

When we process with
[`FrontmatterProc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/frontmatter.html#frontmatterproc),
these will both be removed, and a single raw cell will be added to the
top, containing the combined YAML frontmatter:

``` python
nbp = NBProcessor(_test_file, procs=FrontmatterProc)
nbp.process()
print(nbp.nb.cells[0].source)
```

    ---
    categories:
    - c1
    - c2
    description: A description
    execute:
      echo: false
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
    output-file: docs_test.html
    title: a title

    ---

In addition, a `frontmatter_` attr will be added to the notebook,
containing this information as a `dict`:

``` python
d = nbp.nb.frontmatter_
d
```

    {'execute': {'echo': False},
     'title': 'a title',
     'description': 'A description',
     'key1': 'value1',
     'key2': 'value2',
     'categories': ['c1', 'c2'],
     'output-file': 'docs_test.html'}
