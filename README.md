`nbdev` is a system for *exploratory programming*. Simply write
notebooks with lightweight markup and get high-quality documentation,
tests, continuous integration, and packaging for free!

`nbdev` makes debugging and refactoring your code much easier than in
traditional programming environments since you always have live objects
at your fingertips. `nbdev` also promotes software engineering best
practices because tests and documentation are first class.

-   **Documentation** is automatically generated using
    [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and hosted on [GitHub
    Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Docs support LaTeX, are
    searchable, and are automatically hyperlinked (including
    out-of-the-box support for many packages via
    [`nbdev-index`](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev-index)). You also
    have fine-grained control over how cells are displayed.
-   **Publish packages to PyPI and conda** as well as tools to simplify
    package releases. Python best practices are automatically followed,
    for example, only exported objects are included in `__all__`
-   **Two-way sync between notebooks and plaintext** source code
    allowing you to use your IDE for code navigation or quick edits.
-   **Tests** written as ordinary notebook cells are run in parallel
    with a single command. You have fine-grained control over which
    tests are run.
-   **Continuous integration** out-of-the-box with [GitHub
    Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that run your tests on
    each push and rebuild docs on each merge.
-   **Git-friendly notebooks** with tools that clean unwanted metadata
    and render merge conflicts in a human-readable format.
-   … and much more! See the [Getting Started](#Getting-Started) section
    below for more.

## Install

With pip:

    pip install nbdev

With conda:

    conda install -c fastai nbdev

Note that `nbdev` must be installed into the same Python environment
that you use for both Jupyter and your project.

## FAQ

### Q: Someone told me not to use notebooks for “serious” software development!

[Watch this video](https://youtu.be/9Q6sLbz37gk). Don’t worry, we still
get this too, despite having used `nbdev` for a wide range of “very
serious” software projects over the last three years, including [deep
learning libraries](https://github.com/fastai/fastai), [API
clients](https://github.com/fastai/ghapi), [Python language
extensions](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore), [terminal user
interfaces](https://github.com/nat/ghtop), and more!

## nbdev in the wild

### fastai ecosystem

`nbdev` has been used to build innovative software in the fastai
ecosystem, including the [`fastai`](https://docs.fast.ai/) deep learning
library which implements a [unique layered API and callback
system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04688), and
[`fastcore`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/), which supercharges Python
leveraging its dynamic nature. Furthermore, `nbdev` allows a very small
number of developers to maintain and grow a [large
ecosystem](https://github.com/fastai) of software engineering, data
science, machine learning, and devops tools.
