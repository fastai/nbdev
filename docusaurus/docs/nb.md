# Beautiful Technical Documentation with nbdoc and Docusarus

> [nbdoc](https://github.com/outerbounds/nbdoc) is a lightweight version of [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev) that allows you to create rich, testable content with notebooks.  [Docusarus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a beautiful static site generator for code documentation and blogging.  This project brings all of these together to give you a powerful documentation system.

## Setup


1. First, create an isolated python environment using your favorite tool such as `conda`, `pipenv`, `poetry` etc.  Then, from the root of this repo run this command in the terminal:

    ```sh
    make install
    ```

2. Then you need to open 3 different terminal windows (I recommend using split panes), and run the following commands in three seperate windows:

    _Note: we tried to use docker-compose but had trouble getting some things to run on Apple Silicon, so this will have to do for now._

    Start the docs server:
    
    ```shell
    make docs
    ```

    Watch for changes to notebooks:
    
    ```sh
    make watch
    ```

    Start Jupyter Lab:
    
    ```sh
    make nb
    ```

3. Open a browser window for the docs [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs).  In my experience, you may have to hard-refresh the first time you make a change, but hot-reloading generally works.

## Authoring In Notebooks

**For this tutorial to make the most sense, you should view this notebook and the rendered doc side-by-side.  This page is called "Authoring Docs With Notebooks"**  This tutorial assumes you have some familiarity with static site generators, if you do not, please visit the [Docusarus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

### Create Pages With Notebooks

You can create a notebook in any directory.  When you do this, an associated markdown file is automatically generated with the same name in the same location.  For example `intro.ipynb` generates `intro.md`.  For pages that are created with a notebook, you should always edit them in a notebook.  The markdown that is generated can be useful for debugging, but should not be directly edited a warning message is present in auto-generated markdown files.

However, using notebooks in the first place is optional. You can create Markdown files as you normally would to create pages.  We recommend using notebooks whenever possible, as you can embed arbitrary Markdown in notebooks, and also use `raw cells` for things like front matter or MDX components. 

### Front Matter & MDX

The first cell of your notebook should be a `raw` cell with the appropriate front-matter.  For example, this notebook has the following front matter:

```
---
title: Authoring Docs With Notebooks
---
```

Consult the [Docusaurus docs on front matter](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-markdown-features#markdown-front-matter) to see the various options available to you.

### Markdown

You can include any markdown in markdown cells.  One markdown feature that can be really useful for docs is for rendering diffs.  A `diff` code block can be specified like this:

    ```diff
    + added this line
    this line is the same
    - deleted this line
    ```
And is rendered as like this:

```diff
+ added this line
this line is the same
- deleted this line
```

#### Static Site Generator Features

Since you can write markdown in notebooks, you can also take advantage of your static site generator's markdown features.  For, example this site uses Docusarus, which means you can use any of its [special markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) such as [admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) or [tabs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/tabs).

### Python Code

Code cells and output will show up in the docs as you would expect:


```python
print('hello world')
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

    hello world


</CodeOutputBlock>

### Python Scripts In Docs

If you use the `%%writefile` magic, the magic command will get stripped from the cell, and the cell will be annotated with the appropriate filename as a title to denote that the cell block is referencing a script.  Furthermore, any outputs are removed when you use this magic command.

This is what the cell input looks like:

```python
%%writefile myflow.py
from metaflow import FlowSpec, step


class MyFlow(FlowSpec):
    @step
    def start(self):
        self.some_data = ["some", "data"]
        self.next(self.middle)

    @step
    def middle(self):
        self.next(self.end)

    @step
    def end(self):
        pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MyFlow()
```

The output is then rendered like this:


```py title="myflow.py"
from metaflow import FlowSpec, step


class MyFlow(FlowSpec):
    @step
    def start(self):
        self.some_data = ["some", "data"]
        self.next(self.middle)

    @step
    def middle(self):
        self.next(self.end)

    @step
    def end(self):
        pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    MyFlow()
```

### Running shell commands

You can use the `!` magic to run shell commands.  When you do this, the cell is marked with the appropriate language automatically.  For Metaflow output, the preamble of the logs are automatically removed.

You may wish to only show logs from particular steps when executing a Flow.  You can accomplish this by using the `#cell_meta:show_steps=<step_name>` comment:

You can show multiple steps by seperating step names with commas:

### Writing Interactive Code & Toggling Visibility

It can be useful to write interactive code in notebooks as well.  If you want to interact with a Flow, we recommend using the `--run-id-file <filemame>` flag.

Note we are hiding both the input and output of the below cell (because it is a bit repetitive in this case) with the `#cell_meta:tag=remove_cell` comment:


```bash
python myflow.py run
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="bash">

     Workflow starting (run-id 1647979602062769):
     [1647979602062769/start/1 (pid 60096)] Task is starting.
     [1647979602062769/start/1 (pid 60096)] Task finished successfully.
     [1647979602062769/middle/2 (pid 60099)] Task is starting.
     [1647979602062769/middle/2 (pid 60099)] Task finished successfully.
     [1647979602062769/end/3 (pid 60103)] Task is starting.
     [1647979602062769/end/3 (pid 60103)] Task finished successfully.
     Done!


</CodeOutputBlock>

Notice how parts of the above output are automatically pruned for the docs.  You can also choose to only show certain steps from your Flow with the `meta:show_steps=<step1_name>,<step2_name>` comment:

The cell input looks like this.  Note that the comment is stripped out and only the "middle" step is showing

```python
#meta:show_steps=middle
!python myflow.py run --run-id-file run_id.txt
```


```bash
python myflow.py run --run-id-file run_id.txt
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="bash">

     [1647980445728255/middle/2 (pid 60283)] Task is starting.
     [1647980445728255/middle/2 (pid 60283)] Task finished successfully.
    ...

</CodeOutputBlock>

You will see all of the output in the notebook, but in the docs, only the `middle` step will show!

Furthermore, you can write and run your code as normal and this will show up in the docs:


```python
run_id = !cat run_id.txt
from metaflow import Run

run = Run(f"MyFlow/{run_id[0]}")

run.data.some_data
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">




    ['some', 'data']



</CodeOutputBlock>

It is often smart to run tests in your docs.  To do this, simply add assert statements.  These will get tested automatically when we run the test suite.


```python
assert run.data.some_data == ["some", "data"]
assert run.successful
```

But what if you only want to show the cell input, but not the output.  Perhaps the output is too long and not necesary.  You can do this with the `#meta:tag=hide_output` comment:


```python
print("".join(["This output would be really annoying if shown in the docs\n"] * 10))
```

You may want to just show the output and not the input.  You can do that with the `#meta:tag=hide_input` comment:

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

    You can only see the output, but not the code that created me
    You can only see the output, but not the code that created me
    You can only see the output, but not the code that created me
    


</CodeOutputBlock>

If you want to hide **both** the input and the output, you can use the `#meta:tag=hide` comment:

## Running Tests

To test the notebooks, run `make test`.  This will execute all notebooks in parallel and report an error if there are any errors found:

### Skipping tests in cells

If you want to skip certain cells from running in tests because they take a really long time, you can place the comment `#notest` at the top of the cell. For example the below cell will not be tested. Go ahead, run `make test` from the root of the repo both with and without the `#notest` comment to see the different behavior.


```python
assert 1 == 1
```

## API Docs

You can compose API docs in notebooks by using `nbdoc.show_doc.ShowDoc`, for example let's see what the API docs for `FlowSpec` looks like:


```python
from nbdoc.showdoc import ShowDoc
from metaflow import FlowSpec, conda
```


<DocSection type="class" name="FlowSpec" module="metaflow.flowspec" heading_level="3" link="https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/tree/master/metaflow/flowspec.py#L48">
<SigArgSection>
<SigArg name="use_cli" default="True" />
</SigArgSection>
<Description summary="Main class from which all Flows should inherit." />
<ParamSection name="Attributes">
	<Parameter name="script_name" />
	<Parameter name="index" />
	<Parameter name="input" />
</ParamSection>
</DocSection>


Even though the API docs will render in the notebook, they will be restyled in the docs.  We render it in the notebook so you can have some visual correspendence to what is being rendered in the docs.

Sometimes, you may want to override what the API docs show because of tricky python objects like decorators.  For example, this is how you would document the conda step decorator:


```python
from metaflow.plugins import CondaStepDecorator
```

If you try to just call `ShowDoc` on `CondaStepDecorator` it will inspect the class as is, which is not ideal:


<DocSection type="class" name="CondaStepDecorator" module="metaflow.plugins.conda.conda_step_decorator" heading_level="3" link="https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/tree/master/metaflow/plugins/conda/conda_step_decorator.py#L37">
<SigArgSection>
<SigArg name="attributes" default="None" /><SigArg name="statically_defined" default="False" />
</SigArgSection>
<Description summary="Conda decorator that sets the Conda environment for your step" extended_summary="To use, add this decorator to your step:\n```\n@conda\n@step\ndef MyStep(self):\n    ...\n```\n\nInformation in this decorator will override any eventual @conda_base flow level decorator.\nParameters\n----------\nlibraries : Dict\n    Libraries to use for this flow. The key is the name of the package and the value\n    is the version to use. Defaults to {}\npython : string\n    Version of Python to use (for example: '3.7.4'). Defaults to None\n    (will use the current python version)\ndisabled : bool\n    If set to True, disables Conda. Defaults to False" />
<ParamSection name="Attributes">
	<Parameter name="conda" />
	<Parameter name="environments" />
</ParamSection>
</DocSection>


Therefore, you can use the arguments `name` and `decorator` to set the right behavior.  (Setting `decorator=True` is the equivalent of setting `objtype='decorator'`):


<DocSection type="decorator" name="@conda" module="metaflow.plugins.conda.conda_step_decorator" heading_level="3" link="https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/tree/master/metaflow/plugins/conda/conda_step_decorator.py#L37">
<SigArgSection>
<SigArg name="..." />
</SigArgSection>
<Description summary="Conda decorator that sets the Conda environment for your step" extended_summary="To use, add this decorator to your step:\n```\n@conda\n@step\ndef MyStep(self):\n    ...\n```\n\nInformation in this decorator will override any eventual @conda_base flow level decorator.\nParameters\n----------\nlibraries : Dict\n    Libraries to use for this flow. The key is the name of the package and the value\n    is the version to use. Defaults to {}\npython : string\n    Version of Python to use (for example: '3.7.4'). Defaults to None\n    (will use the current python version)\ndisabled : bool\n    If set to True, disables Conda. Defaults to False" />
<ParamSection name="Attributes">
	<Parameter name="conda" />
	<Parameter name="environments" />
</ParamSection>
</DocSection>


For metaflow, there is special magic built-in, so we don't need to do anything manually for decorators:


<DocSection type="decorator" name="@conda" module="metaflow.plugins.conda.conda_step_decorator" heading_level="3" link="https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/tree/master/metaflow/plugins/conda/conda_step_decorator.py#L37">
<SigArgSection>
<SigArg name="..." />
</SigArgSection>
<Description summary="Conda decorator that sets the Conda environment for your step" extended_summary="To use, add this decorator to your step:\n```\n@conda\n@step\ndef MyStep(self):\n    ...\n```\n\nInformation in this decorator will override any eventual @conda_base flow level decorator.\nParameters\n----------\nlibraries : Dict\n    Libraries to use for this flow. The key is the name of the package and the value\n    is the version to use. Defaults to {}\npython : string\n    Version of Python to use (for example: '3.7.4'). Defaults to None\n    (will use the current python version)\ndisabled : bool\n    If set to True, disables Conda. Defaults to False" />
<ParamSection name="Attributes">
	<Parameter name="conda" />
	<Parameter name="environments" />
</ParamSection>
</DocSection>


## Formatting code with black

You can choose to format specific code cells with [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with the comment `#meta:tag=black`, or manually adding the cell tag `black` in the Jupyter interface.  For example, notice how the below code is reformatted in the rendered docs:

For example, this is the input code cell:

```python
#meta:tag=black
j = [1,
     2,
     3
]
```

Becomes this:


```python
j = [1, 2, 3]
```

This works with `%%writefile as well`.

For example, this input:

```python
%%writefile black_test.py
#meta:tag=black

def very_important_function(template: str, *variables, file: os.PathLike, engine: str, header: bool = True, debug: bool = False):
    """Applies `variables` to the `template` and writes to `file`."""
    with open(file, 'w') as f:
        pass
```

Becomes this:


```py title="black_test.py"
def very_important_function(
    template: str,
    *variables,
    file: os.PathLike,
    engine: str,
    header: bool = True,
    debug: bool = False
):
    """Applies `variables` to the `template` and writes to `file`."""
    with open(file, "w") as f:
        pass
```

## DataFrames

Pandas Dataframes will be displayed per normal:


```python
import pandas as pd
url = 'https://github.com/outerbounds/.data/raw/main/hospital_readmission.csv'
pd.read_csv(url).head().iloc[:, :3]
```
    
<HTMLOutputBlock >




```html
<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>14</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>2</td>
      <td>30</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>66</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>63</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>40</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>
```



</HTMLOutputBlock>

## Plots

You can generate plots with many plotting libraries, which will automatically show up in the docs. 


```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.plot(range(20), range(20))
plt.plot(range(10), [x+1 for x in range(10)])
plt.show()
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">


    
![png](_nb_files/output_55_0.png)
    


</CodeOutputBlock>

You can even have interactive charts with altair.  Please note that all interactive plotting libraries may not work due to collisions between the static site generator and the plotting library.  If you encounter issues, we suggest saving your plot as an image file to disk then displaying it with a markdown cell.

### Interactive Plots


```python
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

source = data.cars()

alt.Chart(source).mark_circle(size=60).encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Origin',
    tooltip=['Name', 'Origin', 'Horsepower', 'Miles_per_Gallon']
)
```

:::caution

You should be careful when using interactive plots.  Interactive pltos can inject lots of HTML into the page, which can slow things down significantly.  Only create interactive charts when they are helpful.

You can instruct altair to render a chart as a static svg image with this line of code.

```python
alt.renderers.enable('svg')
```

_In order for this to work, you will have to install the [altair_saver](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair_saver) package._

    

:::

Here is the same chart as a static image:


```python
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

source = data.cars()

alt.renderers.enable('svg')
alt.Chart(source).mark_circle(size=60).encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Origin',
    tooltip=['Name', 'Origin', 'Horsepower', 'Miles_per_Gallon']
)
```
